# Playground for Leaflet map with Pixi overlay

This example demonstrates drawing of some random markers using [Leaflet.PixiOverlay](https://github.com/manubb/Leaflet.PixiOverlay).

* To start it, clone the repo and run:

`yarn install && yarn start`

* This will start a [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) dev server using [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) on your local port 6060.
* You may then click on 'View Code' and play around with the marker data.
* See `src/Map.tsx` for full implementation.
